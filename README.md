# MEDWEST60

This repository describes the MEDWEST60 configuration and ensemble simulations performed in 2020 with the [NEMO](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu) ocean model over the Western Mediterranean Sea at 1/60° horizontal grid resolution by [Ocean-Next](https://www.ocean-next.fr/) and the [MEOM group](http://meom-group.github.io) at [IGE](http://www.ige-grenoble.fr).
